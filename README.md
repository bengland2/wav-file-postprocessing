# wav-file-postprocessing
code to post-process existing .wav files

For now this is just a hack to learn about how sound is processed in Linux-accessible APIs.  My first foray was 
pulseaudio because I could not figure out Alsa (no good example and API documentation was not clear).
But I guess pulseaudio is being phased out in favor of pipewire, have no idea how that works.  Oh well... ;-)
